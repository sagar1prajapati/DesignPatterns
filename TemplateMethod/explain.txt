The Template Method design pattern defines 
the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class and 
allows subclasses to provide specific implementations 
for certain steps of the algorithm. It enables code reuse and 
promotes consistent behavior while allowing flexibility 
in certain parts of the algorithm.
